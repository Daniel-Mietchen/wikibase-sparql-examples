# SPARQL examples extracted from wikibase/wikidata

These are SPARQL queries extracted from wikibases: such as wikidata.

Many queries have been fixed automatically if they are not SPARQL 1.1. 
However many still need to be fixed.

Code used to do the crawling and fixing is in [sparql-examples-utils](https://github.com/sib-swiss/sparql-examples-utils/).

Contributions are very welcome!

# Queries are indetified by their MD5

At this moment you can see them [in turtle](https://github.com/JervenBolleman/wikibase-sparql-examples/tree/main/examples/wikidata)
